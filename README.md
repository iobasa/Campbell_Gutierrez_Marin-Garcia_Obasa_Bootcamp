STARTUP AGENCY Design &amp; Coding

## Description

Students in groups of 4 are responsible for designing a professional agency site
(mobile, tablet and desktop) with an original logo & tagline. The groups will also design
and animate a video to promote the new startup advertising agency. The startup agency
is owned by each group member, so every member has a say in the look and feel of the
projects. Stay consistent in the look of the logo through the website and video. Make all
the required elements be cohesive in the brand experience. You will write copy for each
page as well. Come up with headings and body copy that match the tone of your newly
created agencies brand

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Uses CSS3, JavaScript and HTML3 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/), [mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for reference).
Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including Babel for transcription (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
